# Small Robot Butler ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§ Roadmap

## Phase 1 â€“ Base Robot (Mobility + Obstacle Avoidance)
- [ ] Set up ESP32 + Motor driver (TB6612)
- [ ] Assemble DC motors + chassis
- [ ] Install ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
- [ ] Test basic movement and obstacle avoidance

## Phase 2 â€“ Voice Control
- [ ] Connect smartphone app (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for voice â†’ text â†’ command
- [ ] Implement basic commands: come here, stop, move left/right
- [ ] Test response and latency

## Phase 3 â€“ Tool Storage + Pop-up Mechanism
- [ ] Add servo-controlled tool trays
- [ ] Program voice commands to trigger servo presentation
- [ ] Test reliability and speed of tool delivery

## Phase 4 â€“ Extra Functions
- [ ] Mini vacuum module for dust cleaning
- [ ] Upgrade to standalone voice module
- [ ] Mobile app integration with tool inventory
- [ ] Expandable slots and sensor integration

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Add AI-based path optimization
